	<h1>Welcome to Parity!<br><br><br>Parity first started off as a small chatroom for school so we could collaborate, ask
		questions
		to each other, and chill and talk.<br><br><br>And the funny thing is, it turned out to be a disaster.<br><br><br>People
		were getting
		chaotic, the hosting service accused me of stuff, and things were pretty much scrambled just like scrambled eggs
		:/.<br><br><br>But in the end, it was for a learning experience and for fun. In the beginning, it was only me
		(a middle
		schooler), who almost built it entirely on PHP.<br><br><br>And little did I know it would turn out to be much more
		than
		being just a chatroom for school.<br><br><br>Later on, Parity improved more, I got more devs, and in the end, I got
		more
		knowledge and, overall, it was very fun to make!<br><br><br>And when I say we improved it, I REALLY MEAN WE IMPROVED
		IT!<br><br><br>Seriously, it may seem really simple right now to a normal person, but we started with a single page and
		JavaScript echoing out the
		contents of a text box whenever you clicked enter, and then you could only see messages on one screen.<br><br><br>But now here
		we are: Parity, a rip-off off version of Discord.<br><br><br>So here is how Parity works.<br><br><br>There are 4 chat rooms: General, Programming,
		Off Topic, Work, and
		Potato (which is only for people who are on potatoes, if you know what I mean, lol).<br><br><br>Right now, we are currently
		developing other stuff in Parity, such as more rooms (not only chat rooms though), better user experience, etc.<br><br><br>So if you have any questions, suggestions, requests, and possibly also even want to become a dev, then feel free
		to email me!<br><br><br></h1>
