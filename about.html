	<h1>Welcome to Parity!<br><br><br>Parity first started off as a small chatroom for school during COVID times so we
		could collaborate during virtual school<br>(some of our teachers were terrible) and chill.<br><br><br>The funny
		thing is, it turned out to be a disaster because the dev was literal dog water.<br><br><br>Things
		were getting
		chaotic, the hosting service accused me of exploiting their servers, and things were scrambled harder than that
		time I dropped my omlette
		:/.<br><br><br>But in the end, it was a great learning experience and quite fun. In the beginning, it was only
		me
		(a middle
		schooler), who built the entire thing on PHP.<br><br><br>Little did I know it would turn out to
		be much more
		than
		being just a tiny school chatroom.<br><br><br>Later on, Parity improved more and more, I got more devs, and in
		the end, I learned
		a lot, and overall, it was a lot of fun to create!<br><br><br>And when I say we improved it, I REALLY MEAN WE
		IMPROVED
		IT!<br><br><br>Seriously, it may seem really simple right now to a normal person, but we started with a single
		page and
		JavaScript echoing out the
		contents of a text box whenever you clicked enter so that you could only see messages on one
		screen.<br><br><br>But well here
		we are now: Parity, a Walmart version of Discord.<br><br><br>So here's how Parity works:<br><br><br>There are 5
		chatrooms:
		General, Programming,
		Off Topic, Work, and
		Potato<br>(which is only for people who are on potatoes, if you know what I mean, lol).<br><br><br>Right now, we
		are currently
		developing other stuff in Parity, such as more rooms (not only text chat *wink*), better user experience,
		etc.<br><br><br>So if you have any questions, suggestions, requests, and possibly also even want to become a
		dev, then feel free
		to email me!<br><br><br></h1>
